# MINECOLLECTOR
You are a mine collector (X). Navigate the grid and collect mines (*) within the step limit.
*Note: This may or may not resemble Minesweeper whatsoever*

## System Requirements
This is a cross-platform (temporarily only functional on POSIX systems) Python-based game meant to be played in the system console. You must have Python 3 installed on your system in addition to the getch module on posix systems (pip install getch).

## Instructions
Download the minecollector.py file. To load the game, type "python3 *yourdirectory*/minecollector.py" into your console. Navigate the grid using WASD and collect the mines * within the step limit. Each input of WASD counts to your steps. The grid wraps if you navigate off of the edge.

# GOOD LUCK!!
